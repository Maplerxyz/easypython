# EasyPython

EasyPython is a beginner-friendly programming language inspired by Python. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, with simplified syntax and fewer rules than Python.

## Getting Started

To use EasyPython, you will need to download and install the interpreter. You can find the latest version of the interpreter on the [EasyPython GitHub repository](https://github.com/Maplerxyz/easypython/).

Once you have downloaded the interpreter, you can run your EasyPython code by typing the following command in your terminal:

```python3 interpreter.py [filename.ezpy]```

Replace [filename.ezpy] with the name of the EasyPython file you want to run.

## Syntax

EasyPython has a simplified syntax that is easy to read and write. Here are some examples of EasyPython code:

```// Set a variable
var name = "John"

// Print the variable
prnt name
```

In EasyPython, you can set variables using the `var` keyword, and print values using the `prnt` keyword. EasyPython also supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
